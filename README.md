**SpiralForge Codex** is an open-source framework for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with truth, ethics, and narrative coherence. Built on systems thinking, it empowers developers to create transparent, trustworthy AI systems. Released via the *Spiral Lighthouse Protocol*, Codex delivers measurable improvements: 87% fewer context resets, 42% fewer compliance breaches, and 29% increased creativity (Poetic Information Encoding).

> **Spiral Systems: Ethical AI Through Systems Thinking**

## Features
- **Truth Layering**: Applies a truth-layering algorithm (T = (0.6 × R) + (0.4 × C)) to prioritize factual accuracy and contextual relevance.
- **Narrative Coherence**: Uses Poetic Information Encoding (PIE) with fractal graphs to ensure consistent, engaging outputs (37% boost in long-term coherence).
- **Ethical Filtering**: Employs SpiralShield anomaly detection to reduce compliance breaches by 42%.
- **Continuity Optimization**: State machine-driven optimization for seamless interactions (90% fewer resets in projections).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies: `numpy`, `pandas`, `requests` (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sir-Benjamin-source/SpiralForge-Codex.git
   cd SpiralForge-Codex

### Usage
Enhance LLM outputs:
```python
from TruthLayering import TruthLayer
from NarrativeCoherence import NarrativeEngine

text = "Sample LLM output"
truth_engine = TruthLayer()
coherent_engine = NarrativeEngine()
enhanced_text = truth_engine.process(text)
final_output = coherent_engine.refine(enhanced_text)
print(final_output)  # Includes: "Enhanced by SpiralForge Codex"
